# siggraph-maps

Three maps to illustrate a blog post, interpreting the weird world of downtown Los Angeles.

#### Palms

This video-game style uses a few old-school tricks including dithered opacity shadows and animated sprites.

####1988
http://meetar.github.io/?1988.yaml/

Don't let nostalgia cloud your thinking, kids – this was what the 80's looked like, especially towards the end. Simple geometric patterns, and just teal and burgundy everywhere.

When I added the lavender, no fooling, I got the creeps. Too real.

####Galaxy
http://meetar.github.io/?galaxy.yaml/

A nod to more recent tropes, when reflections, glows, and sparkles suggested the innocence of the past mirrored in our collective – yeah I don't know, design was full of starfields for awhile, at least I didn't name it Chillwave.
